## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Development server
In order to deploy a local version of the project you must:
- Download the project from github
- Run `npm install` at the root of the project
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## :muscle: Project Status
Currently the games that are on the site are already working well, if you find any bugs I am willing to fix them or accept solutions. I'm also still thinking about possible games to add to the projector and make the site more entertaining.
